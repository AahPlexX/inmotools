**Last tracked implementation commit:** `ebb6e06ba1113c44cb0efb3ee1641370178170c2`
**Current gate:** G4 — named parameters and constrained sketch system
**Completed gates:** 4 / 16
**Capability target:** 195
**Completed user-facing capabilities:** 0 / 195

## Deterministic completion equation

`COMPLETE = G0..G15 all complete AND completed user-facing capabilities = the authoritative declared capability target (currently 195/195) AND export matrix verified AND exact dependency policy satisfied AND latest CAD branch checks green AND branch reconciled with current main AND final CAD head contained in origin/main AND main validation/Pages deployment green.`

The capability target is a floor rather than a ceiling. It increases whenever later research identifies another materially useful, non-redundant function that is realistically supportable by the local-first browser/GitHub Pages architecture. A capability may leave scope only under an explicitly committed environment limitation, unrelated-domain, superseded, or documented `other` rationale.

A capability counts only when production behavior exists, relevant validation passes, and any required user interaction is usable rather than decorative. Infrastructure alone never increments the capability count.

## Gate ledger

- [x] **G0 — Architecture and dependency governance.** Approved exact-B-Rep architecture, domain boundary, living capability-floor policy, export policy, exact-pin rule, licensing/browser constraints, and implementation plans are committed.
- [x] **G1 — Serializable parametric project engine.** Project/history types, downstream dependency closure, suppression, dirty propagation, dependency-safe reorder, undo/redo, and history limits are implemented and unit-tested.
- [x] **G2 — Canonical units foundation.** Canonical millimeter/radian storage and supported length/angle conversions reject non-finite values and pass unit/build validation.
- [x] **G3 — Semantic topology references.** Provenance + geometry fingerprint scoring resolves unique references and explicitly returns ambiguous/missing rather than silently retargeting geometry.
- [ ] **G4 — Parameters and constrained sketch system.** Complete the expanded sketch-entity contract, named dimensional formulas, cycle/error handling, geometric/dimensional constraints, DOF analysis, drag solve, deterministic conflict isolation, profile/geometry diagnostics, accepted inference proposals, and numerical-library policy.
- [ ] **G5 — Exact OCCT worker kernel.** Re-verified exact dependencies are pinned, route-lazy WASM initializes in a dedicated worker, revision cancellation/restart works, unsupported browsers are explicit, and analytic geometry + STEP/BREP round-trip fixtures pass.
- [ ] **G6 — Exact solid/surface feature evaluator.** Required primitives, extrude/revolve/sweep/loft, booleans, hole, fillet/chamfer, shell/thicken/draft/offset/split/rib, pattern/mirror/helix/thread/text, datums, surfaces, defeaturing, and healing are functional.
- [ ] **G7 — CAD workspace and sketch interaction.** Responsive workspace, model tree, contextual inspector, precision sketch editing, selection, camera/navigation, exact numeric alternatives, undo/redo, feature diagnostics, and command access are functional.
- [ ] **G8 — Inspection and lightweight components.** Exact measurement, mass/inertia/curvature/section inspection, interference/clearance, wall/draft/overhang/print checks, semantic inspection annotations, component instances/relations, motion preview, and exploded presentation are functional.
- [ ] **G9 — Persistence and professional export.** IndexedDB recovery/native project plus verified STEP, 3MF, GLB/glTF, STL, OBJ, SVG/DXF projection, PNG, batch/manifest workflows, and per-format metadata mapping/sidecar behavior are functional.
- [ ] **G10 — Import, direct-edit, mesh, material, and reusable engineering-data workflows.** Exact STEP/XCAF/BREP import, supported sketch/vector imports, explicitly typed mesh/reference imports, raster underlay, exact 3D curves, defeature/direct workflows, named selections, material library, mesh repair/booleans/refinement, and geometry-quality reporting are functional.
- [ ] **G11 — Sheet-metal system.** Base/converted sheet metal, flanges, bends/rips/joints, hems, jogs, reliefs, tabs/forms, lofted sheet metal, bend rules, linked folded/flat patterns, bend tables/sequences, and fabrication flat-pattern export are functional.
- [ ] **G12 — Technical drawings and model-based definition.** Multi-sheet HLR drawings, projected/auxiliary/section/detail/break/flat views, associative dimensions/tolerances, centers/hatching, manufacturing annotations/GD&T, BOM/tables/balloons, title/revision systems, standards, associative regeneration, drawing export, and native model annotations are functional.
- [ ] **G13 — Tolerance, engineering-content, assembly-extension, and any-user command/guidance workflows.** Model tolerance metadata, fits/stacks, standard hardware, gear/rack generation, expanded component patterns/limits/relink/suppression/explodes/BOM, command search, tree filtering, shortcuts/favorites, and guided/standard/precision presentation are functional.
- [ ] **G14 — Accessibility, responsive resilience, performance and recovery.** Keyboard/touch/non-drag alternatives, WCAG 2.2 AA-relevant behavior, 320 CSS px reflow, zoom/text enlargement, worker failure recovery, stale-result protection, memory discipline, route-lazy loading, and large-project safeguards are verified.
- [ ] **G15 — Integration and release proof.** Current main is reconciled without loss of parallel work; CAD registration/focused E2E mapping is integrated; adversarial review passes; latest branch CI is green; final CAD head is merged into main; main CI + Pages deploy succeed; only then may this status change to COMPLETE.

## Current evidence

- G1–G3 remain green from their committed unit/build checkpoints.
- The sketch solver supports point/line/circle geometry, fixed-point/fixed-entity, horizontal/vertical, coincident, distance/horizontal-distance/vertical-distance, length/radius/diameter/angle, perpendicular/parallel/tangent/concentric/equal-length/equal-radius, midpoint/point-on-line/point-on-circle/symmetric-points, disabled constraints, DOF rank analysis, soft drag seeding, and deterministic conflict reporting.
- Formula/reference-dimension support through `13884f5ffd31a358574a0b8ebe4c49280571c407` passed its four new tests; tracker-aligned run `34661768357` passed the full unit suite and production build.
- Public sketch-analysis production is committed at `dfda96a0ad55112cfd2de466b3959a728e32a062`; its tracker-aligned run `34661965781` passed the full unit suite and production build.
- The approved feasibility-gap expansion is committed in spec `8b4fd135152e034726e9c3e1b9edaaf2ae42787a` and implementation plan `ebb6e06ba1113c44cb0efb3ee1641370178170c2`, raising the current floor from 100 to 195 user-facing capabilities and making later feasible additions increase rather than replace that floor.
- Expanded completion-guard RED is committed at `4395264842f82c70f3cf1dd88b5f08f6f8fda44c`. Run `34663532004` produced the intended result: 671 tests passed and exactly three `cad-progress` assertions failed because the pre-expansion ledger still declared the stale implementation SHA, 12 gates, and no 195-capability target.
- Current dependency research still corroborates `occt-wasm@5.0.0`, `manifold-3d@3.5.3`, and `ml-matrix@6.15.0`; fresh verification remains mandatory immediately before package installation and no lockfile is hand-edited.
- Explicit current environment exclusions are IGES I/O (kernel omits TKDEIGES), automatic arbitrary triangle-mesh-to-clean-parametric-B-Rep reconstruction, and guaranteed semantic STEP PMI embedding until the adapter exposes and validates the required path. There are no current `other` exclusions.
- G4 remains open until the expanded sketch/entity/intelligence contract and numerical dependency policy are satisfied; internal foundations do not count as completed user-facing capabilities.
- `main` contains unrelated concurrent work; CAD remains isolated until G15 reconciliation.

## Freshness invariant

`tests/unit/cad-progress.test.ts` compares the SHA above with the newest commit touching CAD production code, any CAD functional/E2E test other than the guard itself, or the authoritative CAD design/dependency/expansion specifications and plans. It also derives the authoritative capability floor from the expansion specification, requires the ledger denominator to match that floor, and validates the declared gate denominator against the sequential gate list. Implementation or scope can therefore expand without silently reverting to a hard-coded ceiling, while stale tracking still fails unit validation.

The shared `.tasks/IN_PROGRESS.md` remains untouched until integration so parallel agents do not overwrite one another.
