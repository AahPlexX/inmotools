**Dependency gate:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-cad-studio-dependency-decision.md`
**Last tracked implementation commit:** `4e54489772e61d7f206fd753c61b20bc0878eccd`
**Current gate:** G4 — named parameters and constrained sketch system
**Completed gates:** 4 / 16
**Capability target:** 195
**Completed user-facing capabilities:** 0 / 195

## Deterministic completion equation

`COMPLETE = G0..G15 all complete AND completed user-facing capabilities = the authoritative declared capability target (currently 195/195) AND export matrix verified AND exact dependency policy satisfied AND latest CAD branch checks green AND branch reconciled with current main AND final CAD head contained in origin/main AND main validation/Pages deployment green.`

The capability target is a floor rather than a ceiling. It increases whenever later research identifies another materially useful, non-redundant function that is realistically supportable by the local-first browser/GitHub Pages architecture. A capability may leave scope only under an explicitly committed environment limitation, unrelated-domain, superseded, or documented `other` rationale.

A capability counts only when production behavior exists, relevant validation passes, and any required user interaction is usable rather than decorative. Infrastructure alone never increments the capability count.

## Gate ledger

- [x] **G0 — Architecture and dependency governance.** Approved exact-B-Rep architecture, domain boundary, living capability-floor policy, export policy, exact-pin rule, licensing/browser constraints, and implementation plans are committed.
- [x] **G1 — Serializable parametric project engine.** Project/history types, downstream dependency closure, suppression, dirty propagation, dependency-safe reorder, undo/redo, and history limits are implemented and unit-tested.
- [x] **G2 — Canonical units foundation.** Canonical millimeter/radian storage and supported length/angle conversions reject non-finite values and pass unit/build validation.
- [x] **G3 — Semantic topology references.** Provenance + geometry fingerprint scoring resolves unique references and explicitly returns ambiguous/missing rather than silently retargeting geometry.
- [ ] **G4 — Parameters and constrained sketch system.** Complete the expanded sketch-entity contract, named dimensional formulas, cycle/error handling, geometric/dimensional constraints, DOF analysis, drag solve, deterministic conflict isolation, profile/geometry diagnostics, accepted inference proposals, true spline constraints, and numerical-library policy.
- [ ] **G5 — Exact OCCT worker kernel.** Re-verified exact dependencies are pinned, route-lazy WASM initializes in a dedicated worker, revision cancellation/restart works, unsupported browsers are explicit, and analytic geometry + STEP/BREP round-trip fixtures pass.
- [ ] **G6 — Exact solid/surface feature evaluator.** Required primitives, extrude/revolve/sweep/loft, booleans, hole, fillet/chamfer, shell/thicken/draft/offset/split/rib, pattern/mirror/helix/thread/text, datums, surfaces, defeaturing, and healing are functional.
- [ ] **G7 — CAD workspace and sketch interaction.** Responsive workspace, model tree, contextual inspector, precision sketch editing, selection, camera/navigation, exact numeric alternatives, undo/redo, feature diagnostics, and command access are functional.
- [ ] **G8 — Inspection and lightweight components.** Exact measurement, mass/inertia/curvature/section inspection, interference/clearance, wall/draft/overhang/print checks, semantic inspection annotations, component instances/relations, motion preview, and exploded presentation are functional.
- [ ] **G9 — Persistence and professional export.** IndexedDB recovery/native project plus verified STEP, 3MF, GLB/glTF, STL, OBJ, SVG/DXF projection, PNG, batch/manifest workflows, and per-format metadata mapping/sidecar behavior are functional.
- [ ] **G10 — Import, direct-edit, mesh, material, and reusable engineering-data workflows.** Exact STEP/XCAF/BREP import, supported sketch/vector imports, explicitly typed mesh/reference imports, raster underlay, exact 3D curves, defeature/direct workflows, named selections, material library, mesh repair/booleans/refinement, and geometry-quality reporting are functional.
- [ ] **G11 — Sheet-metal system.** Base/converted sheet metal, flanges, bends/rips/joints, hems, jogs, reliefs, tabs/forms, lofted sheet metal, bend rules, linked folded/flat patterns, bend tables/sequences, and fabrication flat-pattern export are functional.
- [ ] **G12 — Technical drawings and model-based definition.** Multi-sheet HLR drawings, projected/auxiliary/section/detail/break/flat views, associative dimensions/tolerances, centers/hatching, manufacturing annotations/GD&T, BOM/tables/balloons, title/revision systems, standards, associative regeneration, drawing export, and native model annotations are functional.
- [ ] **G13 — Tolerance, engineering-content, assembly-extension, and any-user command/guidance workflows.** Model tolerance metadata, fits/stacks, standard hardware, gear/rack generation, expanded component patterns/limits/relink/suppression/explodes/BOM, command search, tree filtering, shortcuts/favorites, and guided/standard/precision presentation are functional.
- [ ] **G14 — Accessibility, responsive resilience, performance and recovery.** Keyboard/touch/non-drag alternatives, WCAG 2.2 AA-relevant behavior, 320 CSS px reflow, zoom/text enlargement, worker failure recovery, stale-result protection, memory discipline, route-lazy loading, and large-project safeguards are verified.
- [ ] **G15 — Integration and release proof.** Current main is reconciled without loss of parallel work; CAD registration/focused E2E mapping is integrated; adversarial review passes; latest branch CI is green; final CAD head is merged into main; main CI + Pages deploy succeed; only then may this status change to COMPLETE.

## Current evidence

- G1–G3 remain green from committed unit/build checkpoints. G4 production behavior includes parameter/formula dimensions, reference dimensions, public sketch analysis, DOF/conflict reporting, profile diagnostics, accepted inference proposals, advanced curve entities, finite point-on-curve, generalized conic/arc tangency, true interpolating B-splines, and spline membership/tangency with persistent solver contact parameters.
- Exact-kernel protocol/runtime foundation is implemented: `fb5f59fea1344d3e159074f00ca615c48f151c70` defines revisioned serializable requests/results; `df93fbeb4eb7a50468615092db8175c4190efe6e` provides revision/generation stale-result protection; `a04e6ed61af2c3a9ac4c7539881c68ce0490cb08` owns hard worker lifecycle; and `bd6762384d916247cc739fed2a9f96dd9fca860d` provides lazy runtime validation/error/transfer semantics.
- OCCT browser capability policy at `4e54489772e61d7f206fd753c61b20bc0878eccd` centralizes the exact `occt-wasm@5.0.0` feature floor: WebAssembly, SIMD, tail calls, and Wasm exception handling. Unsupported environments receive one non-recoverable `unsupported-browser` error and kernel initialization is never invoked. Run `34725522700` passed all four focused capability tests and **805 tests overall**; only the expected stale tracker SHA remained before this tracker-only alignment.
- Fresh dependency verification still corroborates `occt-wasm@5.0.0`, `manifold-3d@3.5.3`, and `ml-matrix@6.15.0`. The connected execution environment does not expose a repository shell/package-manager write path, so `package.json`/`pnpm-lock.yaml` remain intentionally untouched rather than hand-edited; dependency installation remains a mechanical G4/G5 blocker.
- Explicit environment exclusions remain IGES I/O, automatic arbitrary triangle-mesh-to-clean-parametric-B-Rep reconstruction, and guaranteed semantic STEP PMI embedding until adapter support is verified. There are no current `other` exclusions.
- G4 remains open solely on the numerical-library/dependency policy. G5 protocol/revision/transport/runtime/capability-policy work is underway but G5 remains open until verified dependencies are installed and the real OCCT adapter/worker, analytic fixtures, and exact round-trips pass.
- `main` contains unrelated concurrent work; CAD remains isolated until G15 reconciliation. PR #28 remains open, draft, and mergeable; its head remains confined to CAD code/tests/docs/tracker.

## Freshness invariant

`tests/unit/cad-progress.test.ts` compares the SHA above with the newest commit touching CAD production code, any CAD functional/E2E test other than the guard itself, or the authoritative CAD specifications/plans. It derives the capability floor from the expansion specification, requires the ledger denominator to match it, and validates the declared gate denominator against the sequential gate list.

The shared `.tasks/IN_PROGRESS.md` remains untouched until integration so parallel agents do not overwrite one another.
