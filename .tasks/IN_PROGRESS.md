# In Progress

- **Markdown Workbench MVP completion (2026-09-16 audit, follow-ups + MVP gaps closed 2026-09-18)** — source highlighting, discoverable syntax guide, touch formatting/search, and draft/file race guards implemented and integrated on `main` (1e9bef1). All work since branches from `main` at `2fb4937` as `fix/markdown-audit-followups`, not yet merged:
  - Audit follow-ups: preview fenced-code language coloring (`code-highlight-engine.ts`), and dedicated browser regression coverage for the delayed file-read/save-during-typing race guards.
  - MVP completion pass (user comparison against markdownlivepreview.com surfaced real gaps): full formatting toolbar (heading/blockquote/inline+block code/lists/rule/image, alongside the existing bold/italic/strike/link/task/table), local paste/drop-to-embed image insertion (data URI, 5 MB cap, nothing uploaded), GitHub-style `[!NOTE]`/`[!TIP]`/`[!IMPORTANT]`/`[!WARNING]`/`[!CAUTION]` alert blockquote rendering, GitHub-style heading anchor ids (shared slug logic with the Outline panel, `user-content-` clobber-prefix accounted for), an Insert Table of Contents toolbar action verified to link-and-land on real headings, and a curated `:shortcode:` emoji set. Syntax guide updated to document all of it.
  - Verification: `tsc` clean; full Markdown unit suite (21 files, ~220+ tests) and full Markdown e2e suite (`markdown-workbench.spec.ts`, `markdown-workbench-ux.spec.ts`, `markdown-mermaid.spec.ts`) pass repeatedly in isolated/light-load runs on desktop+mobile Chromium; production build passes. `@lezer/highlight` and `unist-util-visit` promoted from transitive to explicit dependencies, pinned to already-resolved lockfile versions. Details: `docs/markdown-audit-2026-09-16.md`.

- **Web Layout Studio** — local responsive layout, design-token and frontend component workstation.
  - Contract and full 60-feature ledger: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-12-web-layout-studio.md`.
  - Current milestone: Sass token map export integrated at 3ec9e435; dedicated Web Layout run 34853354606 passed frozen install, 20 units, build and desktop/mobile browser tests. Pages deployed and the live export control was inspected. Shared Web Layout accessibility timeouts remain unresolved; current repository-wide gates fail in Crystal/Vector unit tests. Full 60-feature ledger remains active with no scope reduction.
  - Completion: every ledger item implemented and verified through reachable UI, validated exports/persistence, script isolation, responsive keyboard access, exact-main checks and Pages deployment. Partial features remain open.
  - Scope: `src/tools/web-layout/`, tool-specific tests, additive catalog/loader integration. Other workstreams and branches are preserved.

- **Catalog-wide audit remediation (TASK-014)** — resolve every accepted finding from the verified catalog audit without silently dropping, weakening, or reclassifying known work.
  - Queue/source: `.tasks/NEXT.md` → `TASK-014: Work through the verified catalog-wide audit backlog`.
  - Current milestone: reconcile the live audit queue against merged fixes, then continue only with still-outstanding verified findings using tool-scoped regression evidence.
  - Latest integrated evidence: Tool 17 / GLSL Sandbox lifecycle and paused-redraw remediation merged through PR #25 at `68accf37f1cc744644e6639f9ff8c102952a7426`; Tool 16 / Convolution Room Profiler findings were verified already resolved on `main` and removed from the outstanding queue rather than reimplemented.
  - Completion gate: every accepted audit finding is either fixed with fresh focused evidence, explicitly rejected with evidence, or deliberately deferred with rationale; no accepted finding is untracked; required validation is green on the exact integrated `origin/main` revision; applicable Pages deployment is green; and the audit entry is moved to `DONE.md`/`WORK_LOG.md` only after those conditions are simultaneously true.

- **Vector Studio** — standards-native local vector illustration workspace with 30+ functional creation/editing capabilities, professional export/metadata workflows, responsive accessibility, focused validation, and Pages verification.
  - Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-vector-studio-design.md`
  - Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-11-vector-studio.md`
  - Current milestone: F — browser validation, adversarial review, integration, and Pages verification
  - Current gate: the pan interaction defect is fixed by capturing the custom pan gesture on the stationary scroll viewport instead of the moving SVG document. Isolated focused validation run `34705678053` passed unit tests, production build, and the full SVG browser spec on desktop and mobile Chromium at `30e1fd78fcb94c1ec3130b639ca9c9f7d5034fae`; the identical Vector source blob is integrated on `main` at `a83e5f96cdf5511ab8397ebc12d5e29b13b4522a` and now requires green focused validation plus the repository Pages workflow on the exact integrated main revision before the milestone can close.
  - Integration gate: exact dependency-policy pins `@playwright/test@1.63.0` and `pnpm@12.3.4` are already integrated on `main` through `fbfade09aec3f73eb70a4d202949329036883947`. The disposable `fix/vector-pan-validation` branch exists only to preserve the isolated browser proof and must not be merged; it can be removed once the exact-main validation evidence is green and branch containment is verified.

- **Photo Studio** — local-first non-destructive photo editor with 30+ functional editing capabilities, professional export/metadata workflow, responsive accessibility, focused validation, and Pages verification.
  - Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-photo-studio-design.md`
  - Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-11-photo-studio.md`
  - Current milestone: A — foundation and global editor

- **Crystal Lattice Studio** — local-first crystallography and crystal-lattice workstation governed by the 163-capability master design.
  - Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-11-crystal-lattice-studio-design.md`.
  - Phase 1 plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-11-crystal-lattice-studio-phase-1.md`.
  - Phase 1 completion: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-11-crystal-lattice-studio-phase-1-completion.md`.
  - Current milestone: Phase 2 — symmetry, local environments, validation, and model building. Phase 1 document/import/export core, interactive structure editing, periodic geometry, project history, publication graphics, and acceptance baseline are integrated.
  - Latest Phase 1 acceptance evidence: all Crystal functional and Task 12 reflow/Axe/keyboard/dialog checks passed in Pages run `34729051007`, job `103648349176`, at `495ee945d60965b7e7e46bd6ed296e9b0fa8bb8d`. That repository-wide job remained red only because three later Web Layout tests failed; no Crystal failure was present.
  - Completion gate: all five master-design phases must be implemented and verified, with every numbered capability accounted for as implemented or explicitly approved under the master scope policy; Phase 1 completion alone is not project completion.
  - Browser note (2026-09-15): one focused Crystal run failed a single mobile supercell case, but the next focused run `35036412161` passed the full Crystal spec, so it was transient and needs no action.
  - Scope: `src/tools/crystal/`, Crystal-specific tests and Crystal design/plan/completion records; unrelated workstreams remain untouched.
