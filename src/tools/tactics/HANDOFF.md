# Tactical Matchboard Studio Handoff

## Workstream identity

- Branch: `feature/tactical-matchboard-studio`
- Original branch base: `4dcc856bc97027862342513cdea7eb769c0ffbc1`
- Last fully browser-validated source tip: `c6550af2a0b32f970983e2aed2c70fed68817346`
- Existing PR: **#76 only**; keep it draft/open/unmerged. Do not create a parallel Tactical Matchboard PR.
- Milestone: **Task 6 — spatial analysis**
- Verified functional features: **20/60**
- Registration: Tactical Matchboard Studio is registered in the catalog and lazy workspace loader.

Documentation commits after the validated source tip do not change Tactical runtime behavior. The live branch ref is authoritative after documentation updates.

## Exact next sequential action

Execute **T06-01 — spatial analysis** in the recorded dependency order:

1. RED tests for physical-Euclidean Voronoi territory and team convex-hull/centroid/width/depth geometry.
2. GREEN pure analysis engine with no new dependency.
3. Passing-lane clearance and authored orientation/vision sectors.
4. Configurable positional grid, distance rings and dynamic tethers.
5. Timeline occupancy heat map plus source-labelled authored/imported trajectory distance/speed metrics.
6. Source-honest responsive UI/SVG overlays with text equivalents; no probability, GPS, intent or officiating claims.
7. Run focused units, TypeScript/build, desktop/mobile browser, Axe, keyboard and reflow evidence before promoting rows 27–34.

## Task 5 closure evidence

Task 5 is **DONE** at runtime source `c6550af2a0b32f970983e2aed2c70fed68817346`. Repository units and production/PWA build pass. Workflow run `36204645295` executed the complete Tactical browser spec in desktop/mobile Chromium with no Tactical failures: 36 passed plus 2 intentional mobile duplicate Axe/reflow skips. The workflow's 12 failures were outside Tactical scope.

## Current verified feature rows

Verified: **1, 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26**.

In progress: **3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 27, 51, 52, 55, 56, 59**.

All other accepted rows remain planned until their dependency-ordered work begins. The deterministic denominator remains 60.

## Core architecture that must be preserved

- Browser-local/static architecture only: no auth, backend database, telemetry, remote project processing, cloud project storage, client secret/API key, or AI product surface.
- Canonical positions use normalized `[0,1]` coordinates; physical calculations derive from pitch metre dimensions.
- Timeline/project time uses integer milliseconds.
- Pure deterministic engines own geometry, timing, and validation; React owns accessible interaction state.
- Scene-owned entities keep explicit scene/layer ownership.
- Timeline preview samples an immutable presentation copy; scrubbing/playback must not pollute canonical project state or undo history.
- Analytics must remain source-honest: geometric outputs are not probability, GPS, intent, or officiating claims.
- Preserve exact-pinned dependencies; do not add/upgrade dependencies without current official + registry verification and a demonstrated need.
- Continue test-first for new behavior/defects, but do not duplicate already-proven tests or reimplement dependency/library functionality.

## Multi-agent / branch rules

- Stay on `feature/tactical-matchboard-studio`.
- Use existing PR #76 only.
- Before every mutation, compare the last known branch tip with the live remote ref. If another agent advanced it, refresh and reconcile before writing.
- An ACTIVE queue item's Primary files are reserved.
- Forward agent takes the lowest-numbered READY item.
- Reverse agent takes the highest-numbered READY item whose dependencies are DONE and whose Primary files do not overlap ACTIVE work.
- Never force-push, destructively rebase, delete the branch, or merge partial work.
- Reconciliation with then-current `main` remains T14 after the branch-complete gate.

## Known non-Tactical repository context

A prior consolidated repository unit run had one unrelated Markdown Chicago author-date timeout. Do not chase unrelated failures from this workstream unless current Tactical changes demonstrably cause them.

## Documentation contract

Whenever material Tactical state changes, update together:
- `src/tools/tactics/FEATURE_MATRIX.md`
- `src/tools/tactics/TODO_SEQUENCE.md`
- `src/tools/tactics/HANDOFF.md`
- `.tasks/IN_PROGRESS.md`
- existing PR #76 summary when its milestone/count/evidence becomes stale.
